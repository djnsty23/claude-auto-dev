# A gate that cannot fail is not a gate

These four failure modes were hit independently by two sessions on the same day,
working on unrelated problems — a mutation harness for a token generator, and a
test-vacuity sweep across a plugin marketplace. Both arrived here the hard way.
Each one produces a **green result that means nothing**, and each is invisible
from the summary line.

## 1. Run the real thing. Never grade a copy.

A check that rebuilds what it is checking grades its own reconstruction. It
passes happily while the shipped artefact emits something else.

- A token gate must **run the real generator in `--check`** and read its exit
  code, not assemble the CSS it expects and diff that.
- A retry-policy test must **import the real function**. One in a production repo
  reimplemented `withTransientRetry` inline; the copy was faithful when compared,
  which is the most dangerous state for a copy to be in — it looks like evidence.

If speed is the reason for the copy, make the *slow part* injectable instead. A
2s/8s/32s backoff became an optional parameter that production never passes; the
real function then runs in milliseconds under test.

The same trap has a timing form: a gate that regenerates an artefact and *then*
reads it compares the generator against its own output and is green forever. One
production repo shipped a stale manifest twice that way, with preflight passing
both times. Snapshot what was **on disk** — what a commit would actually have
shipped — before any regeneration runs.

## 2. Assert a population floor

**No output never differs from no output.** A drift check that compares generated
against committed passes forever once the generator silently emits nothing.

Every check over a collection needs a floor asserted separately from the
comparison:

- a generator: *at least N tokens, N shells, N themes*
- a parity check across two sets: *both sets non-empty, and the same keys*
- a scan: *at least one file was actually scanned*

The same shape appears in test tooling: a suite whose subject is stubbed to
nothing still exits 0, so "the suite passes" proves nothing about the stub.

The sharpest statement of it comes from a production preflight that had already
learned it, and it is worth keeping in these words:

> **A verdict emitted before the work.**

Its success line used to print before a single file was opened, so it said the
same thing whether the directory held 200 files or did not exist at all. The fix
was to move the line to the end and give it the count it actually read — *"so an
empty scan is visible instead of reassuring."* That repo now carries an explicit
`read 0 files, so nothing was checked` branch. Copy the shape.

## 3. A canary must fire, and fire for the RIGHT reason

Confirm two things about every deliberate breakage:

1. **It fired at all.** A mutation that matches nothing proves nothing. If a
   canary reports an assertion vacuous, suspect the *mutation* first — one that
   fell back to a different data source could never have matched.
2. **It fired for the reason you think.** A harness that removed a JSON entry
   without its preceding comma broke the file, so every test threw — which looked
   exactly like the gates correctly firing. An anchor that matches a substring in
   two places does the same.

The check is cheap: run **one** case by hand and read the actual assertion text.

## 4. Never read a summary line as a verdict

> `4 tests failed` and `4 gates fired` look identical from the summary line.

Counts are not findings. Before reporting one, open it:

- a "never called" count mixed dead code with CLI entry points, platform-gated
  code, and untested-but-live branches — **11 reported, 1 actually dead.**
  Chasing it to zero would have deleted five working commands.
- a survivor count from a mutation tool overstated the debt several times over,
  because the tool takes one suite and the subject had six.
- an orphan count was ~90% false positives from one regex artefact.

And the negative form, which is worse because nothing looks wrong: **an assertion
that something is NOT reported passes when the fixture never reached the code at
all.** Two fixtures did this in one file — repos that were never discovered, and
a state the function returns early on. Both looked like passing tests.

## Before shipping a gate

- [ ] It runs the real implementation, not a reconstruction.
- [ ] It fails when the population is empty, not just when it differs.
- [ ] Each deliberate breakage was confirmed to fire, and for the right reason.
- [ ] Every negative assertion was confirmed to reach the code it denies.
- [ ] No count was reported without reading its members.
