# Changelog

## [4.0.0] - 2026-02-03

### Breaking Changes
- Archived v3.9 (19 commands, 14 skills, 8 hooks → archive/v3.9/)
- New skill structure using SKILL.md in directories
- Native TaskCreate/TaskUpdate replaces prd.json for active work

### Added
- **Native Tasks Integration** - Uses Claude Code's built-in task system
  - TaskCreate/TaskUpdate/TaskList/TaskGet with metadata
  - blocks/blockedBy dependencies built-in
  - Session-scoped persistence - no file I/O during work
- **Hybrid Task System** - Two-layer architecture
  - prd.json = Long-term memory (sprint history, verification notes)
  - Native Tasks = Short-term memory (current session work)
  - 92% token reduction (~35K → ~2.6K per session start)
- **Resolution Learning** - Documents HOW issues were fixed
  - `resolution` field in prd.json schema
  - Pattern format: `[CATEGORY]: [SPECIFIC FIX]`
  - Auto-inject warnings on similar errors
- **Parallel Swarm Audit** - 6 specialized agents run simultaneously
  - Security (secrets, XSS, CORS, injection)
  - Performance (memo, effects, re-renders, N+1)
  - Accessibility (WCAG, keyboard, contrast, aria)
  - Type Safety (any, ts-ignore, type conflicts)
  - UX/UI (loading states, empty states, error handling)
  - Test Coverage (critical paths, untested hooks)
  - Produces severity-rated report with scores
- **Proactive Brainstorm** - YOU propose, user doesn't ask
  - Parallel scans for TODOs, console.logs, hardcoded colors
  - Presents concrete improvement scenarios with impact/effort
  - Never asks "what do you want?" - proposes based on findings

### Changed
- **skills/audit/SKILL.md** - Parallel swarm architecture
- **skills/brainstorm/SKILL.md** - Proactive proposals
- **skills/core/SKILL.md** - Hybrid task system documentation
- **Auto mode** - No more Ralph Loop dependency

### Philosophy
- Context is expensive - minimize prd.json reads
- Learn from mistakes - document resolutions
- Parallel execution - 6 agents faster than 1 comprehensive scan
- Use native tools when available (TaskCreate over prd.json)

---

## [3.9.0] - 2025-01-25

### Added
- **Auto Mode v2** - Self-bootstrapping autonomous development
  - Detects Ralph Loop for true non-stop execution
  - Bootstrap from project context if no prd.json exists
  - Auto-verify UX tasks with browser checks
  - Outputs `<promise>` tag for Ralph completion
- **Brainstorm auto mode** - Generates tasks without asking when called programmatically
- **Ralph Loop integration** - Suggests `/ralph-loop` if not already running

### Changed
- **auto.md** - Complete rewrite with entry point flow diagram
- **brainstorm.md** - Added auto mode vs interactive mode distinction
- Never use `AskUserQuestion` in auto mode - make decisions autonomously

### Philosophy
- "Walk away" development - start it and come back to finished work
- Bootstrap intelligently from CLAUDE.md, README.md, package.json context

---

## [3.8.0] - 2025-01-25

### Added
- **Verification requirement** - Tasks need actual testing, not just build passing
  - `verified: "browser"|"test"|"e2e"` = truly complete
  - `verified: null|"build"` = code complete but unverified
- **Verification matrix** - Different task types require different verification
  - UX: Browser test required
  - Feature: Browser OR unit test
  - Bugfix: Reproduce and verify fix
  - AI: Test with real/mock data
- **Status shows verification** - Verified vs unverified counts

### Changed
- **auto.md** - Verification step required before marking complete
- **core.md** - Schema includes `verified` field
- **status.md** - Shows verification quality metric

### Philosophy
- Build passing is NOT done
- Unverified code is technical debt
- Story quality matters more than velocity

---

## [3.7.0] - 2025-01-25

### Added
- **code-quality.md** - Learned patterns from production mistakes
  - 5 type safety rules (single source of truth, complete Records, Supabase typing)
  - 2 React patterns (no nested interactives, hooks at top level)
  - Error handling patterns (auth errors, storage quota)
  - Query key factory pattern
  - Mistake logging format with categories

### Changed
- **core.md** - Enhanced prd.json schema
  - Added `type` as required field
  - Task scoping rules (split if >5 files, >8 criteria)
  - Field validation rules with examples
  - ID format: `TYPE-NAME##`
- **auto.md** - Added learned code quality rules section
  - Type safety checklist from recurring mistakes
  - Enhanced decision logging format with rationale/trade-offs
- **manifest.json** - Added `requires` field for skill dependencies

### Context Optimization
- code-quality.md auto-loads with auto/review commands
- Prevents recurring mistake patterns before they happen

---

## [3.6.0] - 2025-01-25

### Changed
- **94% context reduction** - Slimmed build.md from 548 to 61 lines
- **Granular skill loading** - Each command loads only its specific file
- **Archived build-reference.md** - 1074 lines of redundant content removed
- **New core.md** - Minimal 43-line prd.json schema reference

### Context Savings
- "status" command: ~3K → ~300 tokens
- "auto" command: ~3K → ~1K tokens
- Estimated 60-70% reduction in initial context per command

---

## [3.5.0] - 2025-01-25

### Added
- **Sprint mode** - Time/milestone-based development cycles
  - `sprint 3h` - Run for 3 hours
  - `sprint "all P1 done"` - Run until milestone
  - Cycles through: brainstorm → auto → review → polish → security → docs
- **Session lock** - Prevents parallel session conflicts via `.claude-lock`
- **Mistake tracking** - `/mistakes` command to view error patterns

  - `template crud users` - Adds 5 CRUD tasks
- **Batch commits** - Commit every 3 tasks instead of per-task
- **Preflight check** - Validates git, build, types before auto mode
- **Handoff export** - `/handoff` generates session summary for continuity
- **Context audit** - Analyze and optimize context window usage

### Changed
- **Auto mode hardened** - Explicitly forbidden from using AskUserQuestion
